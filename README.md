//============================
directory organization for this repository matches the following:

  ```
  FriendFinder
    - app
      - data
        - friends.js
      - public
        - home.html
        - survey.html
      - routing
        - apiRoutes.js
        - htmlRoutes.js
    - node_modules
    - package.json
    - server.js
  ```

The survey questions are on a scale of 1-5.

```
	*5 üòÅ | Strongly agree
	*4 üòå | Agree
	*3 üòê | Neutral
	*2 üòï | Slightly disagree
	*1 üòñ | Strongly disagree
```

* The html-routes.js file includes the following two routes:
	* A GET Route to `/survey` which displays the survey page.
	* A USE route that leads to `home.html` which displays the home page. 

* The `api-routes.js` file includes the following two routes:
	* A GET route with the url `/api/friends`. This will be used to display JSON data of all possible friends

Each of these objects follow the format below:

```json
{
  "name":"Ahmed",
  "photo":"https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/p/6/005/064/1bd/3435aa3.jpg",
  "scores":[
      5,
      1,
      4,
      4,
      5,
      1,
      2,
      5,
      4,
      1
    ]
}
```

	* A POST route `/api/friends` will be used to handle the current incoming survey results. In addition this route hold the compatibility logic for the friend match. 

   		
* Compatibility matching is determined based on the following.
	* User's results is capture in a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
	* Then will compare the difference between the user's scores against other users' scores, question by question. Then will add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
		* Example: 
			* User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
			* User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
			* Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

	* The person with the closest match will be the one with the "least" amount of difference.

* Once the closest match has been determined, it will display the result back to the user in the form of a modal pop-up. 

* The result will display both the name and picture of the closest match.
